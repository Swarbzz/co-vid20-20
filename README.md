This project was completed remotely.

Our goal was to create a website that allowed creative people to post free tutorials on whatever they would like to share.

As a user you have the option to follow, like and even donate to that creator.

This project was inspired by the CO-VID 19 outbreak where most of the world had to respect social distancing and have most of their lives occur in the online world. 

# Quickstart

First, clone this repository. Then: 

```ruby
$ bundle install
$ rails db:create
$ rails db:migrate

$ bundle exec rspec #to run the tests
$ rails s #start the server
```
